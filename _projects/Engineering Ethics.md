# Engineering Ethics: Designing for People, Trust, and the Future

This course fundamentally reshaped how I think about engineering. Rather than viewing engineering as a purely technical or profit-driven discipline, I came away with a clearer understanding that engineering is a deeply **human, sociotechnical practice**. My core takeaway was simple but foundational: **don’t engineer for money—engineer for people**. When safety, transparency, and responsibility are treated as primary objectives, technical success and public trust follow.

## Sociotechnical Landscapes and Interactions

Engineering decisions do not exist in a vacuum. Every design choice is shaped by and feeds back into political systems, economic pressures, corporate incentives, cultural expectations, and public perception. This course emphasized that engineers must understand the broader sociotechnical landscape in which their work operates. Requirements, standards, and constraints are often written by people with biases and competing interests, and engineers must critically evaluate them rather than accept them unconditionally.

## Engineering Standards and Regulations

Engineering standards exist to promote safety, consistency, and interoperability. They represent accumulated lessons from past successes and failures and should be followed deliberately and in proper order. However, standards can lag behind innovation and are not a substitute for sound engineering judgment.

Regulations are typically reactive. Many are implemented only after catastrophic failures occur. While they serve as essential safeguards for public safety, they often struggle to keep pace with rapid technological development. This course highlighted the importance of engineers engaging with regulators and recognizing that regulatory compliance is a minimum requirement, not the definition of ethical engineering.

## Engineering Ethics and the Boeing 737 MAX Case Study

A major component of this course was an in-depth case study of the **Boeing 737 MAX**, which provided a concrete example of how ethical failures emerge from the interaction of technical design, corporate pressure, and regulatory breakdowns.

We examined how the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) was introduced to address aerodynamic changes without sufficient redundancy, transparency, or pilot training. The failure was not a single bad design choice, but a chain of decisions driven by cost reduction, schedule pressure, and the desire to avoid retraining requirements. Engineers raised concerns, but those concerns were overridden by business priorities.

This case study reinforced several critical lessons. **Safety must always override profit and schedule pressure.** Engineering ethics are most difficult—and most important—when following them puts an engineer at odds with their employer. Systems should never rely on single-point failures when human lives are at stake. Transparency with regulators, operators, and the public is essential to maintaining trust.

Understanding how the 737 MAX failure happened made it clear that preventing similar disasters requires stronger internal ethical cultures, empowered engineers, rigorous systems-level thinking, and accountability at every organizational level.

## Ethics of AI

AI introduces new ethical challenges because it often functions as a black box. Engineers are responsible for outcomes they may not be able to fully explain or trace. This course emphasized that AI must be used intentionally, verified rigorously, and never trusted blindly. Delegating decision-making to AI does not remove human accountability; it increases the need for careful oversight and ethical judgment.

## Diffusion of Innovation and Envisioning the Future

Technologies are adopted at different rates by different groups, from early adopters to skeptics and late adopters. Engineers must understand how innovations diffuse through society and tailor design, testing, and communication accordingly. Learning from historical successes and failures—including disasters like the 737 MAX—is essential when envisioning and responsibly developing future technologies.

## Engineering for Circular Economies

The course emphasized designing with the full product lifecycle in mind. Engineers play a key role in determining whether products are reusable, repairable, recyclable, or destined for waste. While designing new products is often cheaper in the short term, circular design offers long-term environmental and societal benefits. Sustainability must be embedded early in the design process, not treated as an afterthought.

## Building Trust in Engineering

Public trust is one of the most valuable and fragile assets in engineering. It is built slowly through transparency, consistent performance, and a demonstrated commitment to safety. It can be destroyed instantly by negligence, secrecy, or prioritizing profit over people—as clearly demonstrated by the Boeing 737 MAX case. Understanding public perception is therefore critical to the successful implementation of any engineering system.

## Conclusion

This course reframed engineering as a discipline rooted in responsibility, accountability, and human impact. Engineering is not just about solving technical problems, but about **learning from past failures, designing for people, respecting standards and regulations, and earning public trust**. The lessons from the Boeing 737 MAX underscore that ethical engineering is not optional—it is foundational to the profession and to the safety of the society engineers serve.
